## The Problem 🚨

Citizens in many communities face persistent civic problems: potholes, overflowing rubbish bins, broken streetlights, and neglected public spaces. Existing reporting systems are often slow, confusing, or completely unknown to most residents. Government apps exist, but a lack of transparency, accessibility barriers like language, and a missing feedback loop mean that citizens often submit reports into a black hole, leading to frustration and disengagement.

    cd citycare/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ``` 

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    PORT=5000

    # Gmail credentials for Nodemailer (use an App Password)
    EMAIL_USER="your_gmail_address@gmail.com"
    EMAIL_PASS="your_gmail_app_password"
    ```

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
