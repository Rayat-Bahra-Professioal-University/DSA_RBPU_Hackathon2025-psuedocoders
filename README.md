CityCare: Civic Issue Reporting Platform

CityCare is a full-stack MERN application designed to empower citizens by providing a platform to report local civic issues. It features an interactive map, secure user authentication with OTP verification, image uploads, and an admin dashboard for officials to track and resolve reported problems.

Of course! Your project is well-structured and covers a lot of great features for a MERN stack application. The backend code is solid, with a clear separation of concerns, and the frontend is nicely componentized.

To address your request:

Backend Check: Your backend is in excellent shape. The routes, controllers, and models are well-defined. The use of middleware for authentication (protect), admin authorization (admin), and file uploads (multer) is implemented correctly. The OTP verification system is a fantastic feature.

Frontend Next Steps: You've successfully built the AllIssuesPage. The next logical step is indeed creating a detailed view for a single issue where users can also see and add comments.

Below is a professional README.md file for your project. It includes a comprehensive setup guide and a dedicated section at the end called "Implementing the Issue Detail & Commenting Page" to guide you on building the feature you asked about.
